--user_rb_summary aggregates traits of multiple Report-Backs per SignUp into a single row
--so they can be analized as a single fact of reporting back
--user_rb_summary is used in the final table which will be referenced by Looker in view:
--campaign_funnel
--which is used to generate dashboards:
--Campaign Journey Dashboard (https://dsdata.looker.com/dashboards/183)
--Marketing Journey Dashboard (https://dsdata.looker.com/dashboards/184)
