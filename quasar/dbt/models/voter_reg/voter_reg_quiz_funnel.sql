--This code simplifies the multiple steps that anonymous users AND members take IN the Voter-Registration Quiz 
--which lauched IN dosomething.org IN Jan-2020
--Each row is a unique combination of device_id, session_id, northstar_id AND post_id. 
-- A northstar_id can be null AND CASEs LIKE this, represent anonymous sessions WHERE no user was auTHENticated. 
-- A device_id - session_id combination that has been associated with one or multiple northstar_ids is not present again AS an anonymous session even if the start of the session was anonymous AND got auTHENticated later on. 
-- A device_id can be present multiple times associated with both a northstar_id AND a null northstar_id, across different sessions
-- There are 457 device_id, session_id, northstar_id combinations that repeat because the same auTHENticated session session was mapped to multiple post_ids (registration events)

--The registration event identified AS a reportback with vr_source='web' AND vr_source_details LIKE '%VoterRegQuiz%' is mapped to the quiz funnel by northstar_id AND timestamp 
--(start of the registration occurring within the session, extending the session-end for an additional 15 minutes). 
--Restricting the registration event to occur exactly within the web session start/end times was resulting IN a drop of about 1/2 of the registrations. 
--Extending the session for over 15 minutes was not increasing the number of mapped registrations but was making more registrations to get mapped to more than one session. 
--Mapping of registrations to multiple sessions could not be completely eliminated but was reduced to a minimum (161 or 0.05%) AS of Aug 1, 2020.
